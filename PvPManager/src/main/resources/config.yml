# Here you can choose which methods to use to stop 'border hopping' while players are tagged
# Border hopping is when a player gets in PvP and tries to run into a safe zone to escape
# Vulnerable -> Makes players still vulnerable to PvP in safe zones
# Push Back -> Players will be launched back when trying to enter a safe zone (Disabling this might improve performance)  
# Reset Combat Tag -> Only meant for when Vulnerable is true. Toggles whether combat tagging resets while fighting in a safe zone. Works for WorldGuard Only
